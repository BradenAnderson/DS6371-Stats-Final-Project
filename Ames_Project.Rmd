# NOTES AND PART 1 OUTLINE:

# 1) Equal Lines Model <-- Single regression line for all neighborhoods 
# 2) Parallel lines model <-- The neighborhood effects it at constant amount across all values of the response
# 3) Separate lines model <-- The neighborhood effects the slope (interaction terms)

# Statistical slueth page 250: When to Include Interaction Terms
# 1) When a question of interest pertains to interaction (meadowfoam study)
# 2) When good reason exists to suspect interaction
# 3) When interactions are proposed as a more general model for the purpose of examining
#    the goodness of fit for a model without interaction.

# Questions of interest:
# 1) How does the SalePrice of a house relate to the square footage of the house (GrLivArea)?
# 2) Does the relationship between SalePrice and square footage depend on what neighborhood the house is located in?

# STRATEGY FOR QUESTION OF INTEREST #2:
#
# Step 1: Start with the fullest model (separate lines model)
#
# Step 2: Examine the residual plots for the separate lines model to check if the
#         assumptions for an F-test are met. 
#
# Step 3: If assumptions are met, perform a partial F-test for the hypothesis that
#         the interaction terms can be dropped. (i.e. use the separate lines model
#         as the full model and the parallel lines model as the reduced model to check if
#         we can reduce down to using the parallel lines model). A high p-value indicates that
#         the parallel lines model is adequate.
#
# NOTE: Step 3 essentially asks the question, does the relationship between SalePrice and house
#       size change based on what neighborhood you are in? If p-value is high, the slopes can be 
#       the same (parallel lines), and the answer can be: No, the relationship does not change
#       based on neighborhood. If the slopes cannot be the same, the relatioship does change based
#       on neighborhood.
#
# Step 4: If Step 3 showed that the interaction terms can be dropped, we may want to perform
#         another partial F-test for the hypothesis that the intercepts in the parallel lines
#         models are the same (i.e. full model=parallel lines, reduced model=equal lines).
#
# NOTE: Step 4 does not have an entirely logical interpretation in the context of the problem, 
#       because it essentially asks "Does the SalePrice of a house with a square footage of zero
#       change based on what neighborhood you're in?". (A more useful interpretation may be, does the
#       minimum house price change based on what neighborhood you're in, however interpreting this way
#       seems shaky because that is not really what the intercept represents). It must also be noted
#       that attempting to interpret the intercept here is dangerous to begin with, as the minmum
#       house size in the entire dataset is 334 square feet, therefore statements made about houses
#       with square footage below this value require extrapolation, and are therefore dangerous and unlikely
#       to be useful.

# Overall the scatter plot shows strong evidence of a linear trend, however there are a couple concerning (outlier) 
# observations (which we have flagged as observation numbers 131 and 339) that should be investigated. 

# Note that these observation numbers correspond to the rows in the century_df dataframe which has been filtered to 
# only contain observations in the three neighborhoods of interest. (Therefore these observation numbers will be different 
# in the full dataset). 

# Also note that these concerning observations are both in the Edwards neighborhood, and are both large 
# homes that had a unusually low sale price.

               id_extreme_values=TRUE)

# The majority of the residual plot is a reasonable representation of the ideal "random cloud", indicating
# that the linearity assumption is met for the majority of the data. However as mentioned with the scatterplot,
# we see a couple outlieing observations that violate this assumption. 
```

# Indepdence Assumption
```{r}

# From the residual plot above, do not see any "tracking" in the residuals. Based on how the data was collected
# we do not have a reason to suspect that serial or cluster effects exist. The Independence assumption is always
# difficult to be completely confident in without intimate knowledge of the data collection process, however
# we will proceed with caution as if this assumption is met.

# Normality Assumption
```{r}

plot_residual_qq(fit=fit,

# Based on the QQPlot of the residuals shown below, we see that overall the quantiles of the residuals are
# linearly related to the theoretical quantiles of the normal distribution. That said, we again note that there
# are still the same few observations raising concern as they do not meet the normality assumption. 
# An "S" shape in a residual QQPlot indicates that one of the distributions (the observed or theoretical), has a 
# longer tails than the other. Here we see observation 339, and perhaps 169 and 190 as well being the
# source of some long-tailedness which violates the normality assumption.

# The residual histogram confirms what we see in the residual QQplot. This plot offers another perspective
# but tells the same story; that are a few observations causing some significant skew which violates 
# the normality of errors assumption.

               flag_extreme_values=TRUE, 
               id_extreme_values=TRUE)

# Lastly, we review the plot of externally studentized residuals in the context of the normality assumption.
# We see that, for the most part, the residuals seem to be normally distributed around zero, and are not
# consistently shifted in either the positive or negative direction which would be indicative of a 
# heavily skewed distribution. This plot does help identify some potential outliers that may not fit the
# normality assumption. In particular, we note that observations 131, 169, 190 and 339 are all more
# than three standard deviations away from zero and therefore may warrant further inspection.
```

# Equal Variance Assumption
```{r}

plot_residuals(fit,

               flag_extreme_values=TRUE, 
               id_extreme_values=TRUE)

# Reviewing the residual plot in the context of the equal variance assumption, we do not see any
# "fanning" or "funnel shaped" pattern in the plot which would clearly indicate of a violation of
# this assumption. Further, the spread of the residuals about zero seems reasonably consistent across
# the range of fitted values for most observations, again with the exception of observations 131 and 339.
# Observations 131 and 339 have rather large residuals, and considering that there are no other
# observations even close to these fitted values it would be rather unusual to observe such large
# residuals in 2 out of 2 samples if they truly were drawn from a population with the same variance
# as the other observations.
